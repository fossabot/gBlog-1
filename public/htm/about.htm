			<h1>About me</h1>
			<p><b class="sentence_b">So you are asking who am I?</b> My name is <b>thegergo02</b>, and I love everything that somehow ties to computers.</p>
			
			<h2>How (and when) you are started using computers?</h2>
			<p><b class="sentence_b">I started using computers when I was 3 years old.</b> I have a picture of myself when I felt asleep with <b>a bottle of milk</b> while sitting in front of the computer! I played on my mom's laptop (it was running Windows XP at the time), my favorite games was GTA: Vice City, NSFW: Most Wanted. Yes, my childhood was great, and no <b class="sentence_b">I'm not a psychopath.</b></p>

			<h2>When you started programming?</h2>
			<p><b class="sentence_b">I was like 8 years old</b> when I discovered <b><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP">PHP</a></b>, you know the great stuff. I built my first websites, then a forum. This got boring, so I tried <b><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++">C++</a></b>. I still don't like it!</p>
			<p>After that I found Unity, and with it <b><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">C#</a></b>. With C# I created so much things! <b class="sentence_b">Chat apps, games, video players, soundboard...</b></p>
			<p>I tried C, it was like C++, I still don't like it.</p>
			<p>I switched to Linux, and I switched C# to <b><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a></b>. <b class="sentence_b">Java is a great language too!</b></p>

			<h2>When you switched to Linux?</h2>
			<p><b class="sentence_b">Now I'm 14 old (still pretty young)</b>, and I switched to <b><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel">Linux</a></b> (<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Mint">Mint</a>, and I don't want to hear that <b class="quote_b">"LINUX IS JUST KERNEL OMGGGGGGG"</b>. I know that...).</p>

			<h2>Are you concerned about your privacy?</h2>
			<p><b class="sentence_b">Absolutely.</b> I deleted my Facebook,Google,Snapchat... accounts, I use Protonmail, I use DuckDuckGo, I use really strong passwords, I switched from Windows, I use (Proton)VPN, I encrypt my pictures, I use 2FA on my accounts... I try to do everything to ensure my privacy.</p>

			<h2>Don't you think you are too paranoid?</h2>
			<p>I always say, <b class="quote_b">"you can't be paranoid enough."</b></p>

			<h2>What are you working with right now?</h2>
			<p><b class="sentence_b">I try to build this blog</b>, with a NodeJS (and Express.Js) backend.</p>

			<h2>What are your plans on the future?</h2>
			<p><b class="sentence_b">I want to learn Japanase</b>, (and if I'm going to get the chance travel there, or move there), <b class="sentence_b">be a software developer.</b></p>

			<h2>What do you do in your free time?</h2>
			<p>Other than programming, I watch <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime">anime</a> (you know that <b class="quote_b">"chinese animation"</b>).</p>
